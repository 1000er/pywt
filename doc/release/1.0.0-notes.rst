PyWavelets 1.0.0 Release Notes
==============================

.. |MATLAB|  unicode:: MATLAB U+02122 .. with trademark sign

.. contents::

PyWavelets is a Python toolbox implementing both discrete and continuous
wavelet transforms (mathematical time-frequency transforms) with a wide range
of built-in wavelets.  C/Cython are used for the low-level routines, enabling
high performance.  Key Features of PyWavelets are:

  * 1D, 2D and nD Forward and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT and IDWT)
  * 1D, 2D and nD Multilevel DWT and IDWT
  * 1D and 2D Forward and Inverse Stationary Wavelet Transform
  * 1D and 2D Wavelet Packet decomposition and reconstruction
  * 1D Continuous Wavelet Transform
  * When multiple valid implementations are available, we have chosen to maintain consistency with |MATLAB|'s Wavelet Toolbox.

This release requires Python 2.7 or >=3.5 and NumPy 1.9.1 or greater.
The 1.0 release will be the last release supporting Python 2.7.  It will be a
Long Term Support (LTS) release, meaning that we will backport critical bug
fixes to 1.0.x for as long as Python itself does so (i.e. until 1 Jan 2020).

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

Python 2.6, 3.3 and 3.4 are no longer supported.

The order of coefficients returned by ``swt2`` and input to ``iswt2`` have been
reversed so that the decomposition levels are now returned in descending rather
than ascending order. This makes these 2D stationary wavelet functions
consistent with all of the other multilevel discrete transforms in PyWavelets.
